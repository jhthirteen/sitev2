            <p>I am a rising junior in my degree program. I have interests in many subfields of Computer Science. In particular, I love learning about software development, computer and information security, data science, and machine learning. Additionally, I enjoy studying math, where I find interests in abstract algebra and statistics/probability. I strongly believe that the study of higher-level math leads to better problem solving skills that are applicable to any situation.</p>
            <h1 className="text-sky-500 font-bold">Hobbies:</h1>
            <p>In my free time, I love to stay active. I love training for distance running, rock climbing, and playing pickup basketball. Being local to the Adirondack Mountains and having family in Colorado, I love to get outside and hike when I can as well.</p>
